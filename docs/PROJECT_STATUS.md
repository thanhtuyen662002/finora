## Phase 2 Accepted Baseline

Phase 2 remains accepted PASS and must not be regressed.

Accepted gates:

- Auth/SSR code hardening: PASS
- Remote Phase 2 database structure and least-privilege grants: PASS
- Anonymous RLS isolation: PASS
- Bidirectional two-user RLS isolation: PASS
- Email/password signup/login/confirmation: PASS
- Onboarding routing and persistence: PASS

**PHASE_2 = PASS**

## Phase 3 — Accounts + Categories — Final Receipt

Phase 3 is accepted COMPLETE and is the immutable baseline for Phase 4.

### Source gate

The Phase 3 application/runtime source was verified with matching local/remote HEAD and clean worktree.

- TypeScript: PASS
- Lint: PASS
- Production build: PASS
- Runtime verifier script syntax: PASS
- Verification code changes: NONE

### Remote database structural gate

The corrected Phase 3 migration was manually applied to the target Supabase project. Strict verification returned every mandatory check PASS and `99_OVERALL = PASS`.

Accepted facts:

- `accounts` and `categories` exist with RLS enabled;
- exactly six authenticated ownership policies are present;
- account/category updated-at triggers are present;
- category provisioning trigger on `auth.users` is present;
- Phase 3 SECURITY DEFINER helpers use empty `search_path` and client EXECUTE is revoked;
- `anon` and `PUBLIC` have no table or column privileges on Phase 3 tables;
- authenticated has table-level SELECT only with exact column-level INSERT/UPDATE allowlists;
- `opening_balance` is PostgreSQL `numeric(20,4)`;
- baseline categories were complete for all current auth users;
- no seeded transfer category exists.

**PHASE_3_REMOTE_DATABASE = PASS**
**PHASE_3_STRUCTURAL_GATE = PASS**

### Two-user runtime RLS gate

The hardened two-user runtime verifier exited `0`.

Accepted runtime facts:

- User A/B authentication: PASS
- own account INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE: PASS
- cross-user account INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE blocked: PASS
- account ownership mutation blocked: PASS
- category baseline visibility/isolation: PASS
- own category INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE: PASS
- cross-user category INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE blocked: PASS
- category ownership mutation blocked: PASS
- deliberate non-RLS database error distinction: PASS
- verifier cleanup/archive: PASS

**PHASE_3_TWO_USER_RLS = PASS**

### Live application persistence smoke

Owner-attested live smoke on the Finora Vercel application:

- account create + edit + persistence: PASS
- account archive + unarchive: PASS
- category create + edit + persistence: PASS
- category archive + unarchive: PASS
- refresh + logout/login persistence: PASS
- unexpected live errors: NONE

**PHASE_3_LIVE_PERSISTENCE_SMOKE = PASS**

### Phase 3 authorization receipt

## Phase 4 — Transactions — Source Receipt

The final-corrective agent revision `890184010434e7b88ff8f4050dc6a1d54aae577e` materially improved Phase 4. A bounded repository audit then corrected residual issues directly on `main`.

Accepted source behavior includes:

1. transaction reads fail closed on `public.transaction_details`; there is no fallback to direct numeric table reads;
2. public transaction mutation contracts accept monetary `amount` as string only;
3. create/update/void/restore read back through the exact text view;
4. exact decimal normalization rejects invalid precision instead of silently truncating extra fractional digits;
5. a new transaction never falls back to an archived account when no active account exists;
6. monthly summaries use the actual current calendar month and exact per-currency decimal accumulation;
7. transaction filters derive runtime dates and do not perform cross-currency amount sorting;
8. truthful RFC 4180 CSV export is implemented;
9. void/restore UI is implemented with visible error handling;
10. the runtime verifier contains the full two-user integrity/isolation matrix.

Exact-head verification against source SHA `13287e773eeaa65460bd0980d502bd8885c45f9c` returned:

- local HEAD = remote main: PASS
- worktree clean: PASS
- git diff check: PASS
- TypeScript: PASS
- lint: PASS
- production build: PASS
- runtime RLS script syntax: PASS
- money coercion scan: PASS
- `as any` mutation-path scan: PASS
- exact read fail-closed: PASS
- active/historical selection behavior: PASS
- strict structural verifier inspection: PASS
- runtime full-matrix inspection: PASS

**PHASE_4_SOURCE_GATE = PASS**

## Phase 4 — Remote Database Structural Receipt

The Phase 4 migration `supabase/migrations/20260828000002_phase_4_transactions.sql` has been applied to the target Supabase database.

The strict read-only structural verifier was executed after a verifier-only PostgreSQL type-cast correction at `bb6744692f786a0a86602971ee788567c2d44797`.

All 26 mandatory checks returned PASS and `99_OVERALL = PASS`.

Accepted remote facts:

- `public.transactions` exists and RLS is enabled;
- exactly three authenticated ownership policies exist with the expected SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE semantics;
- no DELETE policy exists;
- `amount` is PostgreSQL `numeric(20,4)`;
- positive-amount, INCOME/EXPENSE, merchant/note-length and currency-code constraints are present;
- no transfer or FX persistence columns exist;
- account FK is exactly `(account_id,user_id,currency_code) -> accounts(id,user_id,currency_code)` with RESTRICT delete action;
- category FK is exactly `(category_id,user_id,type) -> categories(id,user_id,type)` with RESTRICT delete action;
- required composite unique keys exist on accounts and categories;
- the transaction updated-at trigger is wired to `public.handle_updated_at()`;
- anon/PUBLIC have no transaction table or column privileges;
- authenticated has table-level SELECT only plus exact INSERT/UPDATE column allowlists;
- identity, ownership, and timestamps are not client-mutable;
- `account_balances` and `transaction_details` both use `security_invoker=true`;
- `account_balances.current_balance` and `transaction_details.amount` are exposed as text;
- authenticated has SELECT-only access to the views while anon/PUBLIC are excluded;
- no persisted `accounts.current_balance` exists;
- Phase 2/3 RLS remains enabled on profiles, user_settings, accounts, and categories.

**PHASE_4_REMOTE_DATABASE = PASS**
**PHASE_4_STRUCTURAL_GATE = PASS**

## Phase 4 — Two-User Runtime RLS / Integrity Receipt

The hardened runtime verifier was executed against the target Supabase database using only the public Supabase URL/publishable key plus the two disposable test-user credentials. It exited with code `0` and made no source changes.

Accepted runtime results:

- User A authentication: PASS
- User B authentication: PASS
- User A own transaction lifecycle: PASS
- User B own transaction lifecycle: PASS
- cross-user owned-row INSERT blocked: PASS
- cross-user account/category references blocked: PASS
- cross-user SELECT blocked: PASS
- cross-user UPDATE blocked: PASS
- ownership change blocked: PASS
- domain integrity constraints: PASS
- DELETE blocked: PASS
- `security_invoker` view isolation: PASS
- deliberate non-RLS database-error distinction: PASS
- test-record cleanup: PASS

**PHASE_4_TWO_USER_RLS = PASS**
**PHASE_4_RUNTIME_PROCESS_EXIT_CODE = 0**

## Phase 4 — Remaining Gate

Only the live application smoke remains. It must verify transaction create/edit/void/restore, exact derived balances, persistence after refresh, and persistence after logout/login before Phase 4 may close.

## Phase Authorization

- **Phase 0:** PASS
- **Phase 1:** PASS
- **Phase 2:** PASS
- **Phase 3:** PASS
- **Phase 4 Source Gate:** PASS
- **Phase 4 Remote Database:** PASS
- **Phase 4 Structural Gate:** PASS
- **Phase 4 Two-User Runtime RLS:** PASS
- **Phase 4 Live Persistence Smoke:** NOT_RUN
- **Phase 4 Overall:** PARTIAL
- **Phase 5 — Transfers:** NOT AUTHORIZED

## Next Recommended Action

Perform the live Phase 4 persistence and derived-balance smoke on the deployed Finora application. Do not begin Phase 5 until the live smoke passes.
